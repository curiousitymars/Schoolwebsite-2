        <p>Madam Weatherberry's Academy of Magic (Land of Stories Series) is a school, where Madam Weatherberry teaches her very few students to practice and control their magic. Magic has been outlawed in all four kingdoms over time, and the students must prove that magic is a good thing, which can help everyone in the long run. </p>

On the first lesson by the lake, Madam Weatherberry asks all of the students to look at their reflection, and try to perfect themselves. This is the first encouragement.</p>

            <p>On the first lesson, when Madam Whetherberry asks everyone to pull out their true selves with magic, she instructs them to look at their reflection in the lake and do so. On Xanthous' turn, when the flames subside, he is wearing a golden suit, which had a thin layer of fire. A trail of smoke hung off his jacket, and he wore an iron bow tie so heated up that it glowed.</p>

            <p>On the second lesson, Madam Weatherberry asks them to improve a twig. The twig began to twist and curl. It coiled like a snake and grew shiny. Emeralda turned it into a beautiful diamond bracelet, and slid it onto her wrist.</p>
